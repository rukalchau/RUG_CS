# Task Oriented Study System (TOSS)
In the second term in RUG, I will try to develop and apply TOSS in my daily study, in order to create a active learning workflow.

# The model is task oriented, that means the system treats every study as a task, and do it in three phases. 

-  # before study
-  # studying
-  # after study
