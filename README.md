# Task Oriented Study System (TOSS)
In the second term in RUG, I will try to develop and apply TOSS in my daily study, in order to create a active learning workflow.

The model is task oriented, that means the system treats every study as a task, and do it in three phases. 

-  # before study
    - Movtivations/Expecation
    - Questions after scaning the material
-  # studying
    - Take key notes 
    - Write down Questions from material
    - Record the time and rate of understanding of the topic
    - Check the pre questions is answered or not
-  # after study 
    - Document key notes (in 24 hours)
    - Answer Questions (in 24 hours)
    - Knowledge mapping (this could be meaningless at all)
        - TODO: find a model for knowledge map*
        - TODO: find a software to build the map
    - 'flash card' system 
        - DRAFT: in 7 days, in 30 days
