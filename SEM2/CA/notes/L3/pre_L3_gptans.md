# Digital Logic Structure: Answers

## Answers

1. **What is a transistor?**
   - A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals. It is a fundamental building block of modern electronic devices, crucial in digital circuits for its ability to act as a switch or a gate for signals.

2. **How do NOT, NOR, OR, NAND, and AND gates work?**
   - NOT Gate: Inverts the input signal. If the input is 1, the output is 0, and vice versa.
   - NOR Gate: Outputs 0 if at least one of its inputs is 1.
   - OR Gate: Outputs 1 if at least one of its inputs is 1.
   - NAND Gate: Outputs 0 only when all its inputs are 1.
   - AND Gate: Outputs 1 only when all its inputs are 1.

3. **Draw the CMOS circuit for a 3-input AND gate.**
   - The CMOS circuit for a 3-input AND gate typically involves a combination of PMOS and NMOS transistors. The PMOS transistors are arranged in parallel, and the NMOS transistors are in series.

4. **Draw the CMOS circuit for a 4-input XOR gate.**
   - The CMOS circuit for a 4-input XOR gate is more complex, involving a series of PMOS and NMOS transistors in specific arrangements to ensure the exclusive OR operation.

5. **What is a decoder?**
   - A decoder is a digital logic circuit that converts information from an encoded format (usually binary) back into its original format. It's often used in computer memory to find the specific data associated with a binary input.

6. **What is an encoder?**
   - An encoder performs the opposite function of a decoder. It converts data from one format into another, typically from a standard format into an encoded format (like binary).

7. **What is a multiplexer?**
   - A multiplexer (MUX) is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line. It's used when a circuit wishes to transmit data over a single channel.

8. **What is a full adder?**
   - A full adder is a digital circuit that performs addition of numbers. It is capable of adding two one-bit numbers and an input carry. A full adder provides outputs for both the sum and the carry value.

9. **What is an R-S latch?**
   - An R-S (Reset-Set) latch is a simple type of flip-flop circuit, used to store a single bit of data. It has two stable states and can be used to store state information.

10. **What is a D latch?**
    - A D (Data) latch is a type of flip-flop circuit that has a single data input. The output takes the value of the data input at the moment the latch is enabled.
