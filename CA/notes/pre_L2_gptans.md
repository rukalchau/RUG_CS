## How to Represent a Decimal in Binary
To convert a decimal number to binary, divide the number and its subsequent quotients by 2, recording the remainders. The binary representation is these remainders read in reverse order.

## What is a Signed Integer
A signed integer can represent both positive and negative values, commonly using sign-and-magnitude or two's complement representations.

## What is 1's Complement
The 1's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all bits in the number (1s to 0s and vice versa).

## What is 2's Complement
The 2's complement is found by taking the 1's complement of a binary number and adding 1 to the least significant bit. It's widely used for representing signed numbers.

## How to Deal with Fractions
Represent fractions in binary by dividing the fractional part by 2 repeatedly and recording the integer part of the result. The binary fraction is these integers in sequence.

## How to Perform Binary Addition
Binary addition follows the rules: 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, 1+1=10 (with carry over).

## How to Perform Binary Subtraction
Use the 2's complement method for binary subtraction. Convert the subtrahend to its 2's complement and add it to the minuend, ignoring carry beyond the most significant bit.

## What is 'inf' in Computer Science
'Inf' represents 'Infinity', occurring when a number exceeds the representable limit in a floating-point system.

## What is 'Subnormal' in Computer Science
'Subnormal' numbers are values too small to be represented in a normalized format in floating-point systems, allowing representation closer to zero.

## What are BCD Codes
BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) codes are binary encodings where each decimal digit is represented by a fixed number of binary digits (usually four or eight).

## What are Character Sets
Character sets are collections of characters recognized by a computer, where each character is assigned a unique number, like ASCII or Unicode.
